BUILDING FROM SOURCE

test-bigterminal is built using sbt: http://www.scala-sbt.org/
Once you've installed sbt you can download compile dependencies
(scalaSTM, ScalaTest), build, and run the unit tests with

  sbt update test

You can get a list of sbt build targets with "sbt tasks".  If you
compile, or build a JAR, look in target/scala_* for the results.
The Scala version is configured in ./build.sbt.  To run a build
target for all of the versions prefix the action with a "+",
for example "sbt +test".
